# Emoji-Translator

Title: Emoji Translator

Project Overview: 
A translator that helps to translate a sentence with Emoji eg. “Yo what is up my bro (Expressions)(Expressions)?!” into “Yo what is up my bro?! With a cool and funny manner.
And vice versa, helping to translate a full English sentences to Emojis eg. “Hey, are you sad?” to “(Expressions)(Expressions)”
Our goal is to target some adults whom doesn’t have the emoji game compare to the young adults in this generation. So that they could understand what the young adults in this generation is talking about. Hence, we will not be in a lost of translation.

** We have only implemented one method so far into our prototype ** 

Features:
Translating a sentence with Emojis into a sentence in full English containing the emotions and expressions. 
Translatin a sentence with Emojies into a sentence in mostly to full Emojis desceribing the whole sentence. (Not implemented before the deadline so we did not include in this repository) 
The logic of the translation are fetched from Chat GPT OpenAi API.

Conclusion:	
A very good experience for a hackathon consisting of mostly first timers and at the same time, most of us learned a new language on the day itself in order to code this project. A relatively small and fun idea, but we will definitely improve on our next hackathon.
